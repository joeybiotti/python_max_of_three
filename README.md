# Python Max of Three

It wouldn't be a python project if it wasn't a console app!

When run, the user is prompted a number three times, then the program tells the user which of their entries contained the largest number. If all the numbers are the same, the user will get the message: "These numbers are all the same..."

To run this app, fork this repo and pull down the master. Then `cd` into the directory and enter `python app.py`. That's it.
